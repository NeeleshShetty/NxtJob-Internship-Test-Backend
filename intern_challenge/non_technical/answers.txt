3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
->

Using a microservices architecture allows you to break down your application into smaller, independent services. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, which enhances flexibility and scalability.
Example: A simple microservice setup using Express.js.
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to get users
    res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }]);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`User service running on port ${PORT}`);
});
